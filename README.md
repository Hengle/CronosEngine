Cronos Engine is a 3D Game Engine based on OpenGL and made by 2 students (Lucho Suaya and Roger Leon) of the Degree in Videogames Design and Development of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya for the Videogames Engines subject of 3rd course.

We used SDL, SDL_Mixer, STL, OpenGL4, ImGui, Premake, GLM and GLAD.
